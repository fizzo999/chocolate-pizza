# chocolate-pizza
project class10a lab design a website in 4hours

### update 02/10/2021
more detail wotk on refining - chat with Lydia Mynehan-Tubic - I share my research on fonts: Pacifico, Oswald, Nunito - she shares YellowTail for the Delicious - I share the em tagged "E" - to make it upper case and smaller font to mimick the style in the sample layout (talking about D E licious in the header right next to the logo).
I fo=ind the correct resource (you tube video link below) to teach me how to make the custom checkbox with a green arrow and make it responsive - all in CSS - last big hurdle. Now I just need to implement this. In the light of time constraints this is a stretch goal. will get to this later this weekend.

fine tune the design - hunt for fonts:

https://www.fontspace.com/search?q=Oswald
https://www.fontspace.com/search?q=Pacifico

https://www.fontspace.com/search?q=YellowTail

work on styling the li in the recipe list - have not found how to change the blue checkmark to a custom green one - best fix so far - set the opacity to really low (0.4 for all checkboxes and something like 0.2 for the checked checkboxes)

### update 01/22/2021
group project with Matt Simms and Michelle Pannosch

I timed myself on the chocolate pizza and did really well. 3 stints of 20min full speed work. Read instructions, wrote out wireframe, downloaded all the images and put them in a folder; typed out the entire html; finished html and started to style the html, downloaded the font for heading; then I worked as a group project with Matt and Michelle.

And we were only able to do it together. Still took us all the way to the deadline at 5:00pm. But we got it done and I say I am really proud of our work. It looks amazing.
