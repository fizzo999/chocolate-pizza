project class10a lab design a website in 4hours

group project with Matt Simms and Michelle Pannosch

I timed myself on the chocolate pizza and did really well. 3 stints of 20min full speed work. Read instructions, wrote out wireframe, downloaded all the images and put them in a folder; typed out the entire html; finished html and started to style the html, downloaded the font for heading; then I worked as a group project with Matt and Michelle.

And we were only able to do it together. Still took us all the way to the deadline at 5:00pm. But we got it done and I say I am really proud of our work. It looks amazing.
